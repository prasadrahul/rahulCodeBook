/**
 * Micro and Segments
 Your programmer friend Micro has written a program that finds the intersection of two given segments. The program takes 4 integers as input
 l
 1
 ,
 r
 1
 ,
 l
 2
 ,
 r
 2
 l1,r1,l2,r2 and prints the number of points lying in their intersection. For example if,
 l
 1
 =
 1
 ,
 r
 1
 =
 4
 ,
 l
 2
 =
 2
 ,
 r
 2
 =
 6
 l1=1,r1=4,l2=2,r2=6 the intersection of segment will be
 [
 2
 ,
 4
 ]
 [2,4], and number of points lying in the segment is
 3
 3. Now, Micro needs your help in doing the quality assurance of his program.
 You need to provide test cases. Your test cases should include all the conditions and cases that are required to thoroughly test the robustness of the program.

 Output Format:
 Print a single integer
 T
 T, denoting the total number of test cases you're going to print, in the first line.
 In the following
 T
 T lines, print
 4
 4 space separated integers denoting
 l
 1
 ,
 r
 1
 ,
 l
 2
 ,
 r
 2
 l1,r1,l2,r2.

 Sample Output:
 2
 1 4 2 6
 2 5 3 7

 Since these cases cover only some of the many cases, they'll fetch only
 8
 8 points.

 Note: You can not print more than
 30
 30 test cases. And in each test case, make sure that,
 1
 ≤
 l
 1
 <
 r
 1
 ≤
 10
 6
 1≤l1<r1≤106 and
 1
 ≤
 l
 2
 <
 r
 2
 ≤
 10
 6
 1≤l2<r2≤106.

 Sample Code:

 class Sample{
 public static void main(string args[]){
 System.out.println("2");
 System.out.println("1 4 2 6");
 System.out.println("2 5 3 7");
 }
 }
